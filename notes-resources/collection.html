<div class=headerfour><h3>The Road to Bel&eacute;m</h3></div>
<div class="txtnormal" style="margin-bottom: 50px; text-align: left;">
  <p>
    Bounded between the sea and the rail<br>
    I discovered, on the road to Bel&eacute;m,<br>
    That bridges are loud.<br>
    <br>
    A crescendoing cacophony,<br>
    A persistent low rumbling, harsh.<br>
    The grind of metal fades into<br>
    The bass of gently lapping waves,<br>
    Rhythmic against the shore<br>
    Of stone and inviting planes<br>
    <br>
    Slide to nowhere. All the while<br>
    The wind whistles and the trains<br>
    Crash in inverted soundscapes.<br>
    This was the day I realised<br>
    I miss the call of the gull.

<div class=headerfour><h3>The Order of Time</h3></div>
<div class="txtnormal" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
  <p>
    A golden glow<br>
    Bathes the ruins.<br>
    Well-polished clasts,<br>
    From years of handling<br>
    And careful sculpting,<br>
    Jumbled together,<br>
    Flashes of red<br>
    In a sea of grey.<br>
    A speck of muscovite<br>
    Winks at me,<br>
    As the shouting outside<br>
    Echoes, and slowly fades.

<div class=headerfour><h3>Seville</h3></div>
<div class="txtnormal" style="margin-bottom: 50px; text-align: justify;">
  <p>Two years ago I lay on a sleeping bag in Lisbon, sunlight streaming through the windows, reading <i>The Magus</i>. A week ago I found myself lounging on a sofa in Seville, sunlight streaming through the open wooden shutters, re-reading <i>The Magus</i>. <i>The Magus</i> is set in Greece, not Iberia, but the Mediterranean weather was hot and cloudless all the same, framed by narrow streets lined with stout buildings painted earth yellows and pinks, capturing the gentle warmth of sunlight, a diffuse glow, frozen in time.</p>
  <p>Sometimes navigating the city was like wandering through a maze, full of twists and turns and branching alleyways. But the unexpected was always welcome: a secret square complete with a fountain; a beautifully tiled fa&ccedil;ade, each tile intricately crafted in whites and blues amid a sea of earth tones; the streets that came alive under the cover of darkness.</p>
  <p>My memories of Seville are of boozy afternoons, aimless wandering, then after nightfall the thrill of navigating the twisting alleys and crowds, chasing parades late into the early hours of the day, feeling the beat of the drums resonate through my body, allowing myself to be engulfed by the soundscapes. Between the trumpets and the spectator chatter and the seemingly endless rows of hooded figures and candles, there was a sense of solidarity that felt so human yet so foreign, one that transcends the barriers of language and culture and religion, but feels fleeting in today's world.</p>
